# Stay a While and Listen... and Have a Beer

  This is just a dumb category collecting some drinking songs. As you can see
  from the titles, too many are of German origin. They're still good though.

  * Schandmaul: [Der Teufel hat den Schnaps
    gemacht](https://youtu.be/aOwWs7HbVnI) (The devil made the liquor)
  * The Rumjacks: [An Irish Pub Song](https://youtu.be/tDTQQWSmo8s)
  * Versengold: [Thekenmädchen](https://youtu.be/wgfNsek8xkc)
  * Feuerschwanz [Die Hörner Hoch](https://youtu.be/x-A5clw2N3E) (Up the horns;
    yes, people still drink from horns). There also a [great
    performance](https://youtu.be/jEc2C2waNhI&t=2815s) from
    [WAO](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wacken_Open_Air) 2022.
  * In Extremo: [Sternhagelvoll](https://youtu.be/jszqqtS-M-4) is especially
    noteworthy because the video has a 360° view for every scene. "Outside in
    the snow, my name in yellow". Another cameo with
    [Rummelsnuff](germany.md#rummelsnuff).
