# Fnordoglargh's Music

## Motivation

  Over the years I had the pleasure to work with many different people from all
  over the work. Whenever it came to one of my hobbies, music, it was a struggle
  to explain what makes it special for me and why I like what I like to people.
  This is especially true for the co-workers from the Indian subcontinent.

  Imagine you grew up in an isolated bubble like India. You have everything you
  need in terms of TV, music or film right in front of you. The market is now
  larger than the so-called western world. Coming back to my co-workers;
  whenever the topic _music_ came up, most of the time they knew none of the
  bands I liked.  The same thing is true for myself. I have not even scratched
  the cultural surface of music on this world.  Some intricacies will be forever
  hidden from me. But that does not mean, that I cannot appreciate it. So this
  page is mostly for interested parties who want to journey out of mainstream
  music... Well, for most of the time at least. There will be longer sections
  with classic songs to explain the evolution of a genre.

### Why not a playlist?

  I pondered the ideas of playlists, but you won't get as many cool live
  versions e.g. on Spotify. And as of 2023 it also lacks a commentary feature.
  Here I can express myself. On Spotify you can find a [black metal
  playlist](https://open.spotify.com/playlist/1ZSEFfBTPuhOt2V4CQmtAO) that I
  made as challenge for myself: Use only one track per band. That was necessary
  because some of the most liked (Black) Metal playlists simply added whole
  albums which is unimaginative and boring.

  With a few exceptions this is a personal best-of series of artists whose work
  I admire and stuff I love and often listen to.

### Live Versions

  You might wonder why there are so many live versions for the non-electronic
  stuff on the list. The reason is plain and simple; a band has much fewer
  studio tricks at their disposal and has to show their mastery of the
  instruments and material.

### A Warning and some Notes

  * **Warning**: Although I'm trying to use a neutral language here, text
    quotes, song or album titles and the topics explored in the linked songs and
    videos are likely _[not safe for
    work](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Not_safe_for_work)_ (NSFW).
  * Some sections in this page mention bands and artists in chronological order.
    You can expect that some bands or artists show up multiple times.
  * Some genres are not important or interesting for me. In general you can
    assume that what is listed here has significance for me or musical history.
  * The starting page (you are reading right now) is limited to one entry per
    artist or band. Otherwise it could be even more one-sided as it already is.
    Don't worry, that's going to change in the branching pages. The composition
    of the main page focuses on pop and rock music with a few subtle (of not)
    nods to other genres we're going to visit later.
  * With few exception. the bands and solo performers on this list wrote their
    own material. It becomes difficult (for me) to distinguish writers and bands
    when it comes to hip-hop.

### Dedication

  This page is dedicated to Tippu because he made me start it without
  recognizing it. Second is my father because he sparked my own interest in
  music. One Saturday he put headphones on me and introduced me to Kraftwerk's
  [_Radioactivity_](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Radio-Activity) and [_Sgt.
  Pepper's Lonely Hearts Club Band_](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sgt_Peppers)
  by the Beatles. The last one to dedicate this to is my wonderful wife who puts
  up with all my "you absolutely have to listen to this". She is very patient,
  but still does not love Autechre (which is fine).

## 1960s and 1970s

### 1964

  * [The Kinks](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Kinks): Hailed as an
    influential band for both Hard Rock and Heavy Metal because of an early use
    of a distorted guitar playing power chords on [You Really Got
    Me](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/You_Really_Got_Me). Enjoy a [live
    version](https://youtu.be/Eq_KQYVPadQ) from 1965.
  * [The Animals](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Animals), an English rock
    band, recorded and released [their version](https://youtu.be/4-43lLKaqBQ) of
    the the folk song [The House of the Rising
    Sun](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_House_of_the_Rising_Sun). It became a
    timeless classic with many different interpretations.\
    A superior version is from _The White Buffalo (with The Forest Rangers)_
    which was arranged and performed for the finale of the fourth season of the
    FX TV series [Sons of
    Anarchy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sons_of_Anarchy). The lyrics have
    been adapted to mirror the plot of the TV series. The was no spoken dialogue
    in the finale and the filmed scenes together with the music were one of the
    greatest things on TV for us. I still think a more fitting title would have
    been _House of the Rising **Son**_.

### 1967

  * [Jefferson Airplane](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jefferson_Airplane)
    played the Psychedelic and Acid Rock song [White
    Rabbit](https://youtu.be/WANNqr-vcx0) in 1967. Quite a difference between
    them ad the Kinks and the Beatles.
  * [The Beatles](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Beatles) released the
    magnificent album _Sgt. Pepper's Lonely Hearts Club Band_ I mentioned in the
    dedication. It's impossible to be fair to a long-living masterpiece so I'll
    just pick my favorite song which is [A Day in the
    Life](https://youtu.be/usNsCeOV4GM). If you never listened to the album,
    it's worth it.

### 1971

  * [Link Wray](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Link_Wray) released the album with
    his name. One song in particular sparked my interest; [Fire and
    Brimstone](). The Wikipedia article for the album [Link
    Wray](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Link_Wray_(album)) even mentions Swamp
    Rock as a genre and that "the change in style from his earlier work, the
    album was poorly received by Link Wray's fan base. Wray had anticipated
    this, and shortly before the album's release remarked, 'In a way I couldn't
    care less if the album didn't sell a single copy. We're happy with it and
    we've done it our way.'" maybe that's part of the appeal but the sound and
    rhythm stands for itself.\
    I found a live cover by [Cub Koda & The
    Points](https://youtu.be/V-9DwnSMZH8) with a top comment by a user with the
    name _valdane8371_ who said: "I always suspected that the best Rock ‘n’ Roll
    performance ever had taken place in someone’s f**king basement in front of
    seventeen people…now I’m sure.  Bonus points for the glorious absence of
    subtlety."

### 1975

  * [Queen](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Queen_(band)) released [Bohemian
    Rhapsody](https://youtu.be/fJ9rUzIMcZQ) from the album _A Night at the
    Opera_. "Despite being twice as long as the average length of singles during
    the 1970s, the song became immensely popular worldwide." It has 1.6 billion
    views on Youtube as of September 2023. More history about this legendary
    piece of art on the
    [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bohemian_Rhapsody.)
  * [Kraftwerk](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kraftwerk), a German electronic
    band, released their fifth and "first purely electronic album"
    [Radio-Activity](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Radio-Activity). "All
    releases of the album were bilingual, with lyrics in both English and
    German." The [official video](https://youtu.be/NyXeJZJUFHE) is a good
    example how music video started. Now compare that to a
    [version](https://youtu.be/CfSdb9qq3kE) from 2017 _The Catalogue_. The
    sparse lyrics were expanded over the years and also contained a reference to
    the [Fukushima nuclear
    disaster](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fukushima_nuclear_disaster).

### 1979

  * [Bauhaus](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bauhaus_(band)) recorded [Bela
    Lugosi's Dead](https://youtu.be/Yy9h2q_dr9k) as their first ever recording.
    "It is often considered the first gothic rock record." It "was recorded
    'live in the studio' in a single take during a six-hour session".

## 1980s

  What a decade.

  Sound of drums in the 80s: [Gated Reverb](https://youtu.be/Bxz6jShW-3E). Which
  was discovered accidentally while _Peter Gabriel_ recorded the song _Intruder_
  for his third solo album. On drums, on request, _Phil Collins_. 

### 1980

  * [Joy Division](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joy_Division)'s non-album
    single [Love Will Tear Us
    Apart](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Love_Will_Tear_Us_Apart) made a lasting
    impression on the era. Here's the  [official
    video](https://youtu.be/zuuObGsB0No). "Its lyrics were inspired by lead
    singer Ian Curtis's marital problems and struggles with epilepsy. The single
    was released the month after his suicide."

### 1981

  * [Phil Collins](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Phil_Collins), drummer and
    singer in the English band _Genesis_ recorded his debut album [Face
    Value](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Face_Value_(album)). The almost 8 min
    long live version of [In The Air Tonight](https://youtu.be/PEWP9nbqG9Q) from
    2004 is one of the best there is. There's also the [official
    video](https://youtu.be/YkADj0TPrJA) which prominently featured the
    "discovered" sound of gated reverb.

### 1982

  * [Gang of Four](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gang_of_Four_(band)): Beginning
    of the 80s was already [Post-Punk](https://youtu.be/IdrEoOlp0xE). Enjoy [I
    Love A Man In A Uniform](https://youtu.be/wmdUsiQ2qro) a live version from
    the same year played for [The Old Grey Whistle
    Test](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Old_Grey_Whistle_Test). The German
    musician [Herbert Grönemeyer] recorded a good [cover
    version](https://youtu.be/ms20CRIMfck?) in 2021.
  * [Madness](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Madness_(band)): [Our
    House](https://youtu.be/KwIe_sjKeAY)
  * [The Cure](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Cure): [Siamese
    Twins](https://youtu.be/F9GwPDZ4cZ8) (Live In The Tempodrom, Berlin 2002).

### 1984

  * [Talk Talk](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Talk_Talk): I love [Mark
    Hollis](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mark_Hollis)' performance in the
    official video of [Such A Shame)](https://youtu.be/lLdvpFIPReA). It was
    released on the second studio album [It's My Life
    ](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/It%27s_My_Life_(album)).
  * [Tears for Fears]: _Shout_ was released the a single for their second album
    _Songs from the Big Chair_. Here we have the [official
    video](https://youtu.be/Ye7FKc1JQe4) and 35 years later a [live
    version](https://youtu.be/XnWY41GbLbA) from the Roskilde Festival. If you
    look closely, you will see and hear that they kept the original drum machine
    snare for this live performance.

### 1985

  * [Talking Heads](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Talking_Heads): The album
    [Little Creatures](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Little_Creatures) brought
    the successful single [Road to
    Nowhere](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LQiOA7euaYA). 

### 1986

  * [Peter Gabriel](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Peter_Gabriel) released his
    fifth solo album [So](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/So_(album)) and with it
    one of his biggest hits [Sledgehammer](https://youtu.be/OJWJE0x7T4Q). This
    video itself is special in a time before widespread computer animation,
    everything was done by hand. The Stop motion and claymation is still
    something to look at today. The song is played live often. Like this [live
    version](https://youtu.be/_KSxRj9YhG8) from the Growing Up Tour from 2003.
    Fantastic bassline played by [Tony
    Levin](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tony_Levin) and his daughter Melanie on
    backing vocals.
  * [Genesis](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Genesis_(band)), Peter Gabriel's
    former band released their thirteenth album [Invisible
    Touch](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Invisible_Touch). At the hight of the
    cold war and near the end of Ronald Reagan's first term, the band released
    the comical video for [Land Of Confusion](https://youtu.be/TlBIa8z_Mts).
