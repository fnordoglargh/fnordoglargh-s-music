# Fnordoglargh's Music

## Motivation

  Over the years I had the pleasure to work with many different people from all
  over the work. Whenever it came to one of my hobbies, music, it was a struggle
  to explain what makes it special for me and why I like what I like to people.
  This is especially true for the co-workers from the Indian subcontinent.

  Imagine you grew up in an isolated bubble like India. You have everything you
  need in terms of TV, music or film right in front of you. The market is now
  larger than the so-called western world. Coming back to my co-workers;
  whenever the topic _music_ came up, most of the time they knew none of the
  bands I liked.  The same thing is true for myself. I have not even scratched
  the cultural surface of music on this world.  Some intricacies will be forever
  hidden from me. But that does not mean, that I cannot appreciate it. So this
  page is mostly for interested parties who want to journey out of mainstream
  music... Well, for most of the time at least. There will be longer sections
  with classic songs to explain the evolution of a genre.

### Why not a playlist?

  I pondered the ideas of playlists, but you won't get as many cool live
  versions e.g. on Spotify. And as of 2023 it also lacks a commentary feature.
  Here I can express myself. On Spotify you can find a [black metal
  playlist](https://open.spotify.com/playlist/1ZSEFfBTPuhOt2V4CQmtAO) that I
  made as challenge for myself: Use only one track per band. That was necessary
  because some of the most liked (Black) Metal playlists simply added whole
  albums which is unimaginative and boring.

  With a few exceptions this is a personal best-of series of artists whose work
  I admire and stuff I love and often listen to.

### Live Versions

  You might wonder why there are so many live versions for the non-electronic
  stuff on the list. The reason is plain and simple; a band has much fewer
  studio tricks at their disposal and has to show their mastery of the
  instruments and material.

### A Warning and some Notes

  * **Warning**: Although I'm trying to use a neutral language here, text
    quotes, song or album titles and the topics explored in the linked songs and
    videos are likely _[not safe for
    work](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Not_safe_for_work)_ (NSFW).
  * Some sections in this page mention bands and artists in chronological order.
    You can expect that some bands or artists show up multiple times.
  * Some genres are not important or interesting for me. In general you can
    assume that what is listed here has significance for me or musical history.
  * The starting page (you are reading right now) is limited to one entry per
    artist or band. Otherwise it could be even more one-sided as it already is.
    Don't worry, that's going to change in the branching pages. The composition
    of the main page focuses on pop and rock music with a few subtle (of not)
    nods to other genres we're going to visit later.
  * With few exception. the bands and solo performers on this list wrote their
    own material. It becomes difficult (for me) to distinguish writers and bands
    when it comes to hip-hop.

### Dedication

  This page is dedicated to Tippu because he made me start it without
  recognizing it. Second is my father because he sparked my own interest in
  music. One Saturday he put headphones on me and introduced me to Kraftwerk's
  [_Radioactivity_](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Radio-Activity) and [_Sgt.
  Pepper's Lonely Hearts Club Band_](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sgt_Peppers)
  by the Beatles. The last one to dedicate this to is my wonderful wife who puts
  up with all my "you absolutely have to listen to this". She is very patient,
  but still does not love Autechre (which is fine).

## 1960s and 1970s

### 1964

  * [The Kinks](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Kinks): Hailed as an
    influential band for both Hard Rock and Heavy Metal because of an early use
    of a distorted guitar playing power chords on [You Really Got
    Me](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/You_Really_Got_Me). Enjoy a [live
    version](https://youtu.be/Eq_KQYVPadQ) from 1965.
  * [The Animals](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Animals), an English rock
    band, recorded and released [their version](https://youtu.be/4-43lLKaqBQ) of
    the the folk song [The House of the Rising
    Sun](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_House_of_the_Rising_Sun). It became a
    timeless classic with many different interpretations.\
    A superior version is from _The White Buffalo (with The Forest Rangers)_
    which was arranged and performed for the finale of the fourth season of the
    FX TV series [Sons of
    Anarchy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sons_of_Anarchy). The lyrics have
    been adapted to mirror the plot of the TV series. The was no spoken dialogue
    in the finale and the filmed scenes together with the music were one of the
    greatest things on TV for us. I still think a more fitting title would have
    been _House of the Rising **Son**_.

### 1965

  * [Gloria Jones](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gloria_Jones) first recorded
    [Tainted Love](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tainted_Love) and in 1964 and
    released it in 1965. It was written and produced for her as a B-Side of an
    unsuccessful single. Only after it gained underground popularity in the UK's
    club scene. Gloria re-recorded _Tainted Love_ again in 1976, but this
    version also failed to chart.There's a nice [edited
    video](https://youtu.be/EH4yq-goqiA) and a short video of the [story behind
    the song](https://youtu.be/ViWAVwY7LtU) in Gloria's own words.\
    Through the above mentioned popularity of the song, the English
    vocal-and-synth duo [Soft Cell](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Soft_Cell)
    knew about the song.  They recorded [their own
    version](https://youtu.be/XZVpR3Pk-r8) in 1981 which became a hugely popular
    one-hit wonder. Soft Cell's version is arguable the one most people
    recognize.\
    Other versions:
    * [Scorpions](https://youtu.be/IQV9Cpm9jLQ) (a German hard rock band) from
      the 2011 [Comeblack](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Comeblack).
    * [Broken Peach](https://youtu.be/Q45yicposyI) (Halloween Special) a cover
      band from Spain.

### 1967

  * [Jefferson Airplane](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jefferson_Airplane)
    played the Psychedelic and Acid Rock song [White
    Rabbit](https://youtu.be/WANNqr-vcx0) in 1967. Quite a difference between
    them ad the Kinks and the Beatles.
  * [The Beatles](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Beatles) released the
    magnificent album _Sgt. Pepper's Lonely Hearts Club Band_ I mentioned in the
    dedication. It's impossible to be fair to a long-living masterpiece so I'll
    just pick my favorite song which is [A Day in the
    Life](https://youtu.be/usNsCeOV4GM). If you never listened to the album,
    it's worth it.

### 1968

  * [Aretha Franklin](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aretha_Franklin) wrote and
    recorded the soul and funk song "Think" which is still relevant today.
    Arguably because of an unforgettable [version](https://youtu.be/RTXszRHc0qs)
    in the 1980 movie [The Blues
    Brothers](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Blues_Brothers_(film)).

### 1971

  * [Link Wray](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Link_Wray) released the album with
    his name. One song in particular sparked my interest; [Fire and
    Brimstone](). The Wikipedia article for the album [Link
    Wray](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Link_Wray_(album)) even mentions Swamp
    Rock as a genre and that "the change in style from his earlier work, the
    album was poorly received by Link Wray's fan base. Wray had anticipated
    this, and shortly before the album's release remarked, 'In a way I couldn't
    care less if the album didn't sell a single copy. We're happy with it and
    we've done it our way.'" maybe that's part of the appeal but the sound and
    rhythm stands for itself.\
    I found a live cover by [Cub Koda & The
    Points](https://youtu.be/V-9DwnSMZH8) with a top comment by a user with the
    name _valdane8371_ who said: "I always suspected that the best Rock ‘n’ Roll
    performance ever had taken place in someone’s f**king basement in front of
    seventeen people…now I’m sure.  Bonus points for the glorious absence of
    subtlety."

### 1975

  * [Queen](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Queen_(band)) released [Bohemian
    Rhapsody](https://youtu.be/fJ9rUzIMcZQ) from the album _A Night at the
    Opera_. "Despite being twice as long as the average length of singles during
    the 1970s, the song became immensely popular worldwide." It has 1.6 billion
    views on Youtube as of September 2023. More history about this legendary
    piece of art on the
    [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bohemian_Rhapsody.)
  * [Kraftwerk](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kraftwerk), a German electronic
    band, released their fifth and "first purely electronic album"
    [Radio-Activity](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Radio-Activity). "All
    releases of the album were bilingual, with lyrics in both English and
    German." The [official video](https://youtu.be/NyXeJZJUFHE) is a good
    example how music video started. Now compare that to a
    [version](https://youtu.be/CfSdb9qq3kE) from 2017 _The Catalogue_. The
    sparse lyrics were expanded over the years and also contained a reference to
    the [Fukushima nuclear
    disaster](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fukushima_nuclear_disaster).

### 1976

  * [The Eagles](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eagles_(band)) wrote rock history
    with their album [Hotel
    California](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hotel_California_(Eagles_album)).
    The Eagles performed the [title track](https://youtu.be/09839DpTctU) (here
    in a live version from 1977) from the album well over 1000 times.
  * [KISS](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kiss_(band)) (the hottest band in
    world) released their fourth studio album
    _[Destroyer](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Destroyer_(Kiss_album))_. One of
    the songs of that album became a live staple for the band: [Detroit Rock
    City](https://youtu.be/fTqLf1A-Q-4) (live version from 2006).

### 1979

  * [Bauhaus](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bauhaus_(band)) recorded [Bela
    Lugosi's Dead](https://youtu.be/Yy9h2q_dr9k) as their first ever recording.
    "It is often considered the first gothic rock record." It "was recorded
    'live in the studio' in a single take during a six-hour session".

## 1980s

  What a decade.

  Sound of drums in the 80s: [Gated Reverb](https://youtu.be/Bxz6jShW-3E). Which
  was discovered accidentally while _Peter Gabriel_ recorded the song _Intruder_
  for his third solo album. On drums, on request, _Phil Collins_. 

### 1980

  * [Joy Division](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joy_Division)'s non-album
    single [Love Will Tear Us
    Apart](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Love_Will_Tear_Us_Apart) made a lasting
    impression on the era. Here's the  [official
    video](https://youtu.be/zuuObGsB0No). "Its lyrics were inspired by lead
    singer Ian Curtis's marital problems and struggles with epilepsy. The single
    was released the month after his suicide."

### 1981

  * [Phil Collins](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Phil_Collins), drummer and
    singer in the English band _Genesis_ recorded his debut album [Face
    Value](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Face_Value_(album)). The almost 8 min
    long live version of [In The Air Tonight](https://youtu.be/PEWP9nbqG9Q) from
    2004 is one of the best there is. There's also the [official
    video](https://youtu.be/YkADj0TPrJA) which prominently featured the
    "discovered" sound of gated reverb.

### 1982

  * [Gang of Four](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gang_of_Four_(band)): Beginning
    of the 80s was already [Post-Punk](https://youtu.be/IdrEoOlp0xE). Enjoy [I
    Love A Man In A Uniform](https://youtu.be/wmdUsiQ2qro) a live version from
    the same year played for [The Old Grey Whistle
    Test](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Old_Grey_Whistle_Test). The German
    musician [Herbert Grönemeyer] recorded a good [cover
    version](https://youtu.be/ms20CRIMfck?) in 2021.
  * [Madness](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Madness_(band)): [Our
    House](https://youtu.be/KwIe_sjKeAY) is maybe one of the songs one could use
    to explain what ska is (even though there are other influences) to people
    who never heard the genres name.
  * [The Cure](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Cure): [Siamese
    Twins](https://youtu.be/F9GwPDZ4cZ8) (Live In The Tempodrom, Berlin 2002).

### 1983

  * [Nena](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nena) recorded _99 Red Balloons_. There
    are two official videos; one in [German](https://youtu.be/Fpu5a0Bl8eY) and
    one in [English](https://youtu.be/hiwgOWo7mDc). It became in a No. 1 hit in
    several countries and "is one of the best-known German rock songs in many
    parts of the world." The original German version tells an [anti war
    story](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/99_Luftballons#Lyrics).
  * [The Police](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Police), an English rock band
    band, released [Every Breath You Take](https://youtu.be/OMOGaugKpzs)
    (official video, [2008 Live Version](https://youtu.be/wdS-jpFgRo4) if that
    is more to your liking). It is often mistaken to be a love song, but the
    perspective is of a possessive lover (aka stalker). 

### 1984

  * [Talk Talk](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Talk_Talk): I love [Mark
    Hollis](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mark_Hollis)' performance in the
    official video of [Such A Shame)](https://youtu.be/lLdvpFIPReA). It was
    released on the second studio album [It's My Life
    ](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/It%27s_My_Life_(album)).
  * [Tears for Fears](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tears_for_Fears): _Shout_
    was released the a single for their second album _Songs from the Big Chair_.
    Here we have the [official video](https://youtu.be/Ye7FKc1JQe4) and 35 years
    later a [live version](https://youtu.be/XnWY41GbLbA) from the Roskilde
    Festival. If you look and listen closely, you will see and hear that they
    kept the original drum machine snare for this live performance.

### 1985

  * [Talking Heads](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Talking_Heads): The album
    [Little Creatures](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Little_Creatures) brought
    the successful single [Road to
    Nowhere](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LQiOA7euaYA).
  * [Sting](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sting_(musician)) released his debut
    solo album and the song
    [Russians](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Russians_(song)) ([official
    video]((https://youtu.be/wHylQRVN2Qs))) on it. "The song is a commentary and
    plea that criticizes the then-dominant Cold War foreign policy and doctrine
    of mutual assured destruction (MAD) by the United States and the then
    existing Soviet Union.\
    "Sting re-recorded an [acoustic
    version](https://youtu.be/6w3037nq23o) of the song in March 2022, during the
    [2022 Russian invasion of
    Ukraine](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2022_Russian_invasion_of_Ukraine),
    with proceeds going to humanitarian and medical aid in Ukraine. In a
    statement, he said that he 'never thought [the song] would be relevant
    again. But, in the light of one man’s bloody and woefully misguided decision
    to invade a peaceful, unthreatening neighbor, the song is, once again, a
    plea for our common humanity.'"

### 1986

  * [Peter Gabriel](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Peter_Gabriel) released his
    fifth solo album [So](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/So_(album)) and with it
    one of his biggest hits [Sledgehammer](https://youtu.be/OJWJE0x7T4Q). This
    video itself is special in a time before widespread computer animation,
    everything was done by hand. The Stop motion and claymation is still
    something to look at today. The song is played live often. Like this [live
    version](https://youtu.be/_KSxRj9YhG8) from the Growing Up Tour from 2003.
    Fantastic bassline played by [Tony
    Levin](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tony_Levin) and his daughter Melanie on
    backing vocals.
  * [Genesis](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Genesis_(band)), Peter Gabriel's
    former band released their thirteenth album [Invisible
    Touch](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Invisible_Touch). At the hight of the
    cold war and near the end of Ronald Reagan's first term, the band released
    the comical video for [Land Of Confusion](https://youtu.be/TlBIa8z_Mts).

### 1987

  * [Roxette](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Roxette), a pop-band from Sweden (I
    always liked them better when performing as a rock band.) released the
    soft-rock/pop single [It Must Have Been Love](). It became a number one hit
    in the USA and a well-known song after its inclusion in the 1990 romantic
    comedy [Pretty Woman](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pretty_woman) with Julia
    Roberts and Richard Gere. You might watch the [Goodbye
    Scene](https://youtu.be/WA4MKbZBoA8) from the movie again, and then rewatch
    the whole movie.
  * [Suzanne Vega](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Suzanne_Vega) wrote the song
    [Luka](https://youtu.be/VZt7J0iaUD0) which deals with child abuse. It's told
    from the perspective of a boy, talking to a person living in the apartment
    below, pleading, not to ask questions and using tell-tale arguments of a
    victim what he would say if asked. Only in 2023 "she told German radio
    Station Bayern 2 the song is about her own experience with physical abuse."
  * The English electronic music band [Depeche
    Mode](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Depeche_Mode) was already a successful
    and had a large and dedicated fan base when they released _Never Let Me Down
    Again_ on their 1987 album _Music for the Masses_. It is not a love song but
    about drug use. It must have been around that time that I heard the band's
    name for the first time. The brother  In the [official
    video](https://youtu.be/snILjFUkk_A), singer Dave Gahan drives a 1957 BMW
    Isetta. The many different live versions show the development from a sound
    not very different from the studio version (here from the record breaking
    and legendary concert at the [Rose Bowl in Pasadena
    1988](https://youtu.be/8zMd90cMQdQ)) to one being performed by a band
    ([Paris 2001](https://youtu.be/6BysDRGDns0) or [Barcelona
    2009](https://youtu.be/3hULmE-dCyM) or [Barcelona
    2023](https://youtu.be/dBimYtz6aHQ&t=5360s)).
