# Alternative, Dark and Edgy

This title is just a tongue in cheek comment my American neighbor made about my taste in comics. I'll start gently, I promise.

## Choir of Young Believers

  We came to know this band/one-man-project from Denmark when we watched the
  crime series [Bron/Broen](https://www.imdb.com/title/tt1733785/) (aka _The
  Bridge_). This Danish and Swedish co-production is one of the best
  police/detective series you can watch. Don't waste your time with the inferior
  American remake.  While writing these lines, I found out that _Jannis Noya
  Makrigiannis_, the man behind this music project, died in December 2022.

    used for the opening and closing credits for the aforementioned TV series.
    You might also like this [live version](https://youtu.be/DU26Mvi4-to) of the
    DR Pigekoret (girls' choir of the Danish Broadcasting Corporation).
  * [Have I Ever Truly Been Here](https://youtu.be/IidpdhcAfPA). The video is a
    totally unexcited walk through snow by some person.
