# Electronic Music

  Here you are going to find everything predominantly made with electronic
  instruments. Might be dance music and also something more abstract.

## Helena Hauff

  [Helena Hauff](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Helena_Hauff) is a German DJ and
  record producer. More about her style and gear [in her own
  words](https://youtu.be/y0HtvUghB-A).

  * [C45p](https://youtu.be/-62J8q2sSiQ) from her 2017 album _A Tape_.
  * Two hour [electro DJ set](https://www.youtube.com/live/u2qaQLKkVDA) (with
    L.F.T.). In this video they mix vinyl by hand. No tricks. If you mess up, it
    is going to be horrible.
  * A [performance](https://youtu.be/fur59ChiGDw) in Hamburg's
    [Elbphilharmonie](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Elbphilharmonie) followed by
    a short [interview](https://youtu.be/54rJlSMIcps).

## Julia Bondar

  Julia Bondar is a Ukrainian, Barcelona-based electronic music artist, singer,
  and songwriter. She is one of the few who make successful albums almost
  exclusively with modular gear. Especially noteworthy is that she is also very
  transparent about her gear and technique as demonstrated on
  [loopop](https://www.youtube.com/@loopop)'s YT channel in this
  [video](https://youtu.be/oTmYtetA8Bw). Check out a [live
  performance](https://youtu.be/3y0VMyAM5kU) with modular gear.

## Paranoid London

  A British duo (consisting of Quinn Whalley and Gerardo Delgado) which
  "redefined acid house"[^1] in 2007 with their album _Eating Glue_. Enjoy a
  fantastic [live performance](https://youtu.be/NIpts9B9U3Y) with Mutado Pintado
  on the mic with visuals by Bob Jaroc.
